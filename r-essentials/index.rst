R Essentials
#########################

The `R programming language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)>`_ :cite:`r-language` along with the
`Python programming language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>`_ are the two
`scripting languages <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language>`_ that power modern data science.  Data science
in its current form uses many other languages including
`Java <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>`_ and
`Julia <https://docs.julialang.org/en>`_. and `SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_.  It should be noted that SQL
is **not** a programming language in its native form and it may more accurately be described as a
`query language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language>`_.  There are other languages actively being used, but
today the majority of programming code written for the purposes of data science is being written using either Python
or R.  See the `2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey <https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018>`_.

There are advantages and disadvantages of each of these two languages, but both are adequate tools for many data science
applications by themselves.

.. important::

    It is not the intent of these materials that these two modern and capable programming languages be compared and
    contrasted.  On the contrary, these materials are designed to showcase the benefits of the R language.

Furthermore, these learning contents will demonstrate how the two languages can be used together allowing you to
customize your learning environment so you you may always have access to your tools of choice.
