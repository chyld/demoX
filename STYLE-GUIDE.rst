Please adhere to the following guidelines as you create lessons
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Lessons are made up of 3-5 units that address 3-5 learning objectives.
* Each unit correponds 1-to-1 with a learning objective.
* Units are a single page of rst.
* Units have some number of sections.
* Each unit has at least one in-line CFU (check for understanding). 
* Each course will link to the github repo with associated exercises.
* Each course will link a checkpoint that has 5 questions to assess mastery of the learning objectives.
* Every lesson will have a review page with at least one CFU per unit
* Lessons are designed to be completed in 4 hours.  Use the appendices and primers to store additional content.
* Every unit lesson uses scientific references when appropriate.  Style the bib entries in a similar way inside of galvanize.bib
* Every unit should have a section linking to free materials and/or book chapters where the learner can go to learn more
  
In general we would like the units to avoid the feeling of a wall of text.  Text is the glue to hold a lesson together, but there
are several things that can be done to improve the learning experience.

* Include images (especially conceptual drawings)
* Code snippets with ``literalinclude``
* Relevant code examples to bring text to life
* Inline plots
* Tables
  
For titles and sections use this setup as a guide
