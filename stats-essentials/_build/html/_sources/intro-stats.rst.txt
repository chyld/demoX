Statistics Essentials
=======================

Where are we going?
----------------------

Within data science (and perhaps at its core) is the field of `Machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_, which seeks to accomplish two objectives:

  * **Supervised learning** - learn a mapping from inputs :math:`x` to outputs :math:`y`
  * **Unsupervised learning** - given only :math:`x`, learn interesting patterns in :math:`x`
     
These tasks are a form of artificial intelligence that endow a
computer with the capability to represent a general class of patterns.

Then through that representation they have the ability to **predict
outputs** and **identify patterns**.  Note that this is different than
explicitly hardcoding some data relationship into a computer as though
the specific relationship was already known beforehand.

   In order to identify which specific patterns (out of a general class
   of patterns) are present in the data, machine learning makes extensive use 
   of `linear algebra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra>`_---the 
   branch of mathematics that works directly with matrices---in conjunction numerical 
   optimization procedures.  

   This process of identifying a specific instance (out of a general class
   of patterns) that looks as similar to the data as possible
   is called "model fitting".  Once a machine has such a model representation of the data, 
   then it has *learned* the pattern in the data and can use it as a part of
   other programatic instructions designed to accomplish some objective.

Machine Learning versus Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`What is the difference between statistics and machine learning? <https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-machine-learning>`_

**Statistics** and **Machine Learning** represent distinct quantitative analysis 
traditions that developed towards distinctive objectives that 
suited their idiosyncratic access to (primarily computationally) different 
problem solving methodologies and philosophies; 
however, both disciplines are rooted in the common enterprise of 
"data analysis" and so have found common ground on which to reconcile and 
merge methodologies, leading to the current situation in which the line between 
the two has become increasingly blurred. Nonetheless, some general statements related to 
the traditional domains and expertise claimed by each discipline can be made:


**Statistics**

  * utilizes confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and optimal estimators  
  * places paramount importance on characterizing uncertainty in estimation 
  * bases methodological development on distribution and asymptotic theory  

**Machine Learning**

  * utilizes nonparametric and complex models harnessed via regularization  
  * places paramount importance on "out of sample" generalizability/performance
  * bases methodological development on empirical and computational techniques 
    
Objectives
^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of this short course is to (a) equip you with actual quantitative 
tools that you can apply to more effectively tackle problems you're 
interested in using data, and (b) to provide you with a appropriate foundation 
on which you can effectively build a synergistic data science skill set that
leverages
    
  * `Descriptive statistics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics>`_ - mean, median, skewness... 
  * `Inferential statistics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference>`_  - hypothesis testing, interval estimation...
  * `Predictive analytics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics>`_ - supervised learning: regression, classification...
  * `Prescriptive analytics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescriptive_analytics>`_ - unsupervised learning, recommender systems...
