If you try to apply deep-learning or machine learning to every aspect of AI then you will end up wasting a significant amount of time.  At least with today's technology there is no one approach that works for all applications. 


Luis also makes a point that many people mistakenly confuse automation and AI. Automation is using a computer to carry out specific tasks

^^is it is not the creation of intelligence.
