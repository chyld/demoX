Mathematical and Essentials of Data Science

If we use a transportation metaphor we might say that statistics and
`machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_
are the vehicles that take us to both new and familiar places.
We could also think of programming and `software engineering
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering>`_ as the roads
and infrastructure necessary to make travel even possible.  Linear
algebra on the other hand aligns well with the motors and engines that
propel our vehicles.

Linear algebra
===============
	      
Most of us seldom think about *what is under the hood* as we hum
steadily along a nicely paved road, but success as a data scientist
requires at least a fundamental understanding.  Here we present the
essentials of `linear algebra
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra>`_ with the goal that
you become prepared for an educational experience in data science.
You may even come to believe that viewing math through the lens of
matrices and vectors **makes things easier**.

.. important:: The principal focus of this contents is to introduce
   numeric computing, **linear algebra** and basic statistics through
   Python.  There is also an optional primer on **calculus** that is a
   critical peice of several areas of machine learning.
