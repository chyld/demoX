`RAPIDS <https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids>`_ is an open-source suite of software libraries, built on
`CUDA-X <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/cuda-x>`_.  At the core of this system is
`CUDA® <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA>`_, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model
created by `NVIDIA® <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/>`_. CUDA-X a layer on top of it and it is a collection of libraries
and tools that have been created specifically for artificial intelligence and high performance computing.

RAPIDS is capable of executing end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs and in this lesson
we will survey the available tooling, provide some context for how the different tools work get hand-on with several
examples of this exciting addition to the data science ecosystem.
