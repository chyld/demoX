Introduction
*************************************

The company `NVIDIAÂ® <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/>`_. has been working hard
`to accelerate machine learning and analytics <https://developer.nvidia.com/machine-learning>`_ by leveraging GPUs.  It
is no secret that NVIDIA exists to sell
`Graphics processing units <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit>`_ (GPUs) and the company has for
sometime now been an important contributor to both `open-source projects <https://developer.nvidia.com/open-source>`_ and
to `scientific computing in general <https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc>`_.  One interesting example of how NVIDIA has
contributed to scientific technology and tooling while simultaneously promoting the sale of GPUs is in their initiatives
to help `advance the state of  COVID-19 research <https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/06/22/fighting-covid-19-scientific-computing/>`_.

RAPIDS and the rest of the developer tools that have been created to help data professionals were born out of this same
mindset and the result is a powerful ecosystem that is well-integrated with the
`PyData ecosystem <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18168400/the-pydata-ecosystem/20822664>`_.

NVIDIA created RAPIDS in a way that makes use of CUDA primitives for low-level compute optimization.  The developers at
NVIDIA and other contributors have abstracted away most of the implementation details and the result is a number of
interfaces that are both intuitive and aligned with the norms of the Python data science ecosystem.
