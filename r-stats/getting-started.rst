Where are we going?
=====================

We mentioned **Machine Learning** as a major reason to sharpen your basic statistics skills---here's a figure that
provides a little more perspective.  Many of the models and techniques show require large amounts of data to ensure
consistent and reliable performance.  The figure also gives an indication of the vast and diverse set of tools and tasks
that make up the machine learning world.

If you're interested in exploring this fascinating methodology space and
learning how to leverage and apply these powerful tools then you're going to need a fundamental understanding and
serviceable skill set in programming, probability and statistics.

The above figure is part of `Scikit-Learn's <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_ extensive documentation and tutorial
collection.  R has much of the same capabilities as scikit-learn, but they are spread across several packages.

A note on Jupyter
====================

Jupyter notebooks are a way to mix interactive Python with prose as expressed using Markdown. They are also both very
powerful and an industry standard so practice with them is useful.  The caveat is that the majority of your code should
exist as files: scripts, libraries and Packages.  Take care when using notebooks to ensure that your code is in a
re-usable state that is easily tracked by Git or another version control system.

An in-depth understanding of Jupyter notebooks is not necessary for this course, but they are frequently used so it can
be helpful to become familiar with the technology. Here are some resources to help you better understand this computing
environment.
