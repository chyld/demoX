    "1. Use a data ingestion script that readily accepts more data in batch form\n",

    "3. Visual summaries that detail the data (including the number of missing value, columns dropped etc)\n",
    "4. **Through *investigative visualization* identify the factor or factors that explain the Singapore situation**.\n",

    "6. Conclustions and discussion about next steps\n",
