At this point, we have covered data visualization and missing values---two of the key aspects of exploratory data analysis.  Because EDA is a traditional point in the AI enterprise workflow to communicate your findings to key stakeholders, communication will be a running theme for this case study.  As a general rule of thumb, if you are uncertain about the technical abilities of your target audience then make sure to tailor your presentation and language so that non-technical users will understand your message.  For this case study, you will be provided with the same data that was provided in the data ingestion case study. The difference is that you will need to modify the data ingestion script to accommodate missing values.

You are free to use the visualization tools that you are most comfortable with, but keep in mind that as an employee at the AAVAIL company you would be a part of a team and facilitating a collaborative environment is key.  The goal is to create a deliverable that will be used to tell the story of the Singapore data.  This is where the best practices from the data visualization unit should come to mind.  For example, the majority of code should exist outside of your notebook especially if you intend to use it as your deliverable.  You will use a combination of tabular summaries and plotting to carry out your investigation of the data.  Your visualizations should tell the story of the data and the investigative process.  Recall that you are trying to identify the factors that contribute to the unique market situation in Singapore.  The story should begin with descriptions of the data along with a summary of the business problem and it will eventually lead to your findings.  After you have discussed your findings it is typical that you would include some suggestions for next steps in order to stimulate discussion on how the company might proceed.
