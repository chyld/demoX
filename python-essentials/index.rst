The `R programming language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)>`_ :cite:`r-language` along with the
`Python programming language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>`_ are the two
`scripting languages <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language>`_ that power modern data science.  Data science
in its current form uses many other languages including
`Java <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>`_ and
`Julia <https://docs.julialang.org/en>`_. and `SQL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL>`_.  It should be noted that SQL
is **not** a programming language in its native form and it may more accurately be described as a
`query language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language>`_.  There are other languages actively being used, but
today the majority of programming code written for the purposes of data science is being written using either Python
or R.  See the `2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey <https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018>`_.

There are advantages and disadvantages of each of these two languages, but both are adequate tools for many data science
applications by themselves.  These materials are meant to provide a learning path for the Python language though the use
of business relevant examples.
